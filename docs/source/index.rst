Second life: Keep using, keep loving ...
========================================

- Upgrading your appliances for reuse is absolutely in line with the circular economy. 
- What more could you want when it comes to preserving value and sustainability?

**So the question simply arises:**

- How can you convert an A1 Smart Home Gateway into a still up-to-date WiFi access point that also offers a Zwave and a ZigBee module?

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

The `Sercomm <https://www.sercomm.com>`_ NA502 is a ZigBee/Z-Wave gateway and was developed for various solutions of different brands, such as A1 Smart Home Gateway in Austria. It is based on the MediaTek MT7621 SoC with a Gigabit Ethernet port, Z-Wave and ZigBee modules as well as 2.4/5-GHz WiFi adapters

The NA502 and NA502s_(3G) gateway models therefore form the basis for the smart home and IoT services of various providers, such as A1, Mios, VeraSecure, Hornbach and probably a few others.

.. note::

   The NA502s also has a 3G cellular module, but this will no longer play a role in the future as this cellular service is being phased out by the mobile network operators.

.. note::

Important: Some variants, like the Vera gateway, seem to have a crippled U-Boot that don't allow loading code to SDRAM via TFTP. So far, no solution exists for those gateways.
